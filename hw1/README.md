# Jumping Frogs Puzzle

## Intro

Both [main.py](./main.py) and [main.cpp](./main.cpp) implement the same DFS algorithm that finds the steps the frogs need to take to switch places.

## Python

The first implementation of the algorithm was made in Python

## C++

The C++ implementation was created to provide a solution that is faster when compared to the original. Currently this implementation contains the final solution of the task.

## Running the solutions

- on the command line run: ./run.sh [py | cpp] n

Where n is the number of frogs looking in one direction and "py" and "cpp" indicate which implementation should be started.

Running this script will start the chosen implementation for input n and output the execution time.
